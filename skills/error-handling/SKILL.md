# OpenOcean Error Handling Skill

Handle errors and exceptions that occur during OpenOcean swap operations. This skill provides troubleshooting guidance, recovery steps, and fallback strategies.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
1. Any OpenOcean API call returns a `code` other than `200`
2. Token resolution fails (symbol not found)
3. Transaction execution fails (`cast send` errors)
4. Network connectivity issues
5. Unexpected response formats
6. Rate limiting or quota exceeded

## Error Categories

### Category 1: API Errors (HTTP/JSON)

| Code | Meaning | Common Causes | Recovery Steps |
|---|---|---|---|
| 200 | Success | None | Continue normally |
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid parameters, wrong format | 1. Check parameter formats<br>2. Verify token addresses<br>3. Ensure amount is in wei |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Missing/invalid API key | 1. Check API key configuration<br>2. Contact OpenOcean support |
| 403 | Forbidden | Access denied | 1. Check permissions<br>2. Verify chain support |
| 404 | Not Found | Endpoint or resource not found | 1. Check URL path<br>2. Verify chain slug |
| 429 | Rate Limited | Too many requests | 1. Wait 10-30 seconds<br>2. Implement exponential backoff<br>3. Consider enterprise plan |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | OpenOcean server issue | 1. Retry after 30 seconds<br>2. Check OpenOcean status page<br>3. Try alternative chain |
| 502/503/504 | Gateway/Service Unavailable | Network or service issues | 1. Wait and retry<br>2. Check network connectivity<br>3. Try different RPC endpoint |

### Category 2: Business Logic Errors

| Error Pattern | Meaning | Recovery Steps |
|---|---|---|
| `"code": 200, "data": null` | No route found | 1. Check token pair liquidity<br>2. Try different amount<br>3. Use different chain |
| `"code": 200, "data": {..., "outAmount": "0"}` | Zero output amount | 1. Check token decimals<br>2. Verify amount is sufficient<br>3. Try larger amount |
| Invalid token address | Token not recognized | 1. Verify contract address<br>2. Check chain compatibility<br>3. Use token list API |

### Category 3: Token Resolution Errors

| Error | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Symbol not found in registry | Token not in reference list | 1. Use OpenOcean token API<br>2. Ask user for address<br>3. Check alternative symbols |
| Multiple matches found | Ambiguous symbol | 1. Show options to user<br>2. Use market cap ranking<br>3. Ask user to specify address |
| Invalid chain for token | Token not deployed on chain | 1. Check token deployment<br>2. Suggest alternative chain<br>3. Use bridge if available |

### Category 4: Transaction Execution Errors

| Error Message | Meaning | Recovery Steps |
|---|---|---|
| `insufficient funds for gas * price + value` | Not enough native token | 1. Add funds to wallet<br>2. Reduce swap amount<br>3. Use lower gas price |
| `execution reverted: OpenOcean: insufficient output amount` | Price moved beyond slippage | 1. Increase slippage tolerance<br>2. Wait for better price<br>3. Try smaller amount |
| `execution reverted: ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance` | Token not approved | 1. Approve token first<br>2. Check approval amount<br>3. Reset approval if needed |
| `nonce too low` / `nonce too high` | Nonce mismatch | 1. Let wallet manage nonces<br>2. Check pending transactions<br>3. Use higher nonce |
| `transaction underpriced` | Gas price too low | 1. Increase gas price<br>2. Use current market rate<br>3. Wait for less congestion |
| `replacement transaction underpriced` | Competing transaction | 1. Use significantly higher gas<br>2. Cancel pending transaction<br>3. Wait for confirmation |

## Recovery Workflows

### Workflow 1: API Error Recovery

```
1. Check error code and message
2. If 429 (rate limited):
   - Wait 10 seconds
   - Retry once
   - If still failing, suggest waiting longer
3. If 400 (bad request):
   - Validate all parameters
   - Check token addresses
   - Verify amount format
4. If 500 (server error):
   - Wait 30 seconds
   - Retry once
   - Suggest trying later
5. If persistent:
   - Suggest alternative DEX
   - Try different chain
   - Contact OpenOcean support
```

### Workflow 2: Token Resolution Recovery

```
1. Symbol not found:
   - Query OpenOcean token API
   - If found, use it
   - If not found, ask user for address
2. Multiple matches:
   - Show top 3 by market cap
   - Ask user to choose
   - Suggest verifying on explorer
3. Invalid address:
   - Verify on block explorer
   - Check chain compatibility
   - Suggest correct address
```

### Workflow 3: Transaction Execution Recovery

```
1. Insufficient funds:
   - Calculate required amount
   - Suggest adding funds
   - Offer to reduce swap size
2. Insufficient allowance:
   - Provide approval transaction
   - Suggest approval amount
   - Explain approval process
3. Slippage exceeded:
   - Show current price vs quote
   - Suggest higher slippage
   - Offer to requote
4. Gas issues:
   - Check current gas prices
   - Suggest appropriate gas
   - Offer to wait for better conditions
```

## User Communication

### Good Error Messages

**Bad:** "Error: 400"
**Good:** "The API returned error 400 (Bad Request). This usually means one of the parameters is invalid. Let me check: are you sure the token addresses are correct for this chain?"

**Bad:** "Transaction failed"
**Good:** "The transaction failed with error: 'insufficient funds for gas * price + value'. You need at least 0.01 ETH for gas plus the swap value, but the current balance is only 0.005 ETH."

### Actionable Suggestions

Always provide:
1. **What happened** — Clear error description
2. **Why it happened** — Probable cause
3. **How to fix** — Specific steps
4. **Alternative options** — Workarounds

## Fallback Strategies

### Primary Fallback: Parameter Adjustment
- Reduce amount
- Increase slippage
- Use different gas price
- Try different chain

### Secondary Fallback: Alternative Service
If OpenOcean consistently fails:
1. Suggest other aggregators (1inch, Paraswap)
2. Direct DEX access (Uniswap, PancakeSwap)
3. Manual swap via wallet interface

### Tertiary Fallback: Manual Intervention
When automation fails:
1. Provide manual steps
2. Suggest waiting and retrying later
3. Recommend contacting support

## Monitoring and Logging

### What to Log
1. **API calls** — URL, parameters, response code
2. **Token resolutions** — Symbol, address, chain
3. **Transaction attempts** — Hash, status, gas used
4. **Errors** — Full error object, timestamp

### Alert Thresholds
- **Warning**: 3 consecutive API errors
- **Critical**: 10+ errors in 5 minutes
- **Stop**: Balance below minimum for gas

## Testing Error Scenarios

Test these scenarios regularly:
1. **Invalid token** — Non-existent symbol
2. **Insufficient balance** — Ask for more than available
3. **High slippage** — Extreme price movement
4. **Network outage** — RPC endpoint down
5. **Rate limiting** — Rapid consecutive calls

## Prevention Tips

### Before Swap
1. **Validate all inputs** — tokens, amounts, addresses
2. **Check balances** — token + gas
3. **Verify approvals** — ERC-20 allowances
4. **Monitor gas** — current market rates

### During Swap
1. **Set reasonable timeouts** — 30 seconds for API, 2 minutes for tx
2. **Implement retry logic** — with exponential backoff
3. **Monitor progress** — confirm each step

### After Swap
1. **Verify outcome** — check balances, tx status
2. **Log results** — for analysis and debugging
3. **Update state** — mark as complete/failed
