# OpenOcean Skills

Skills for interacting with the [OpenOcean Aggregator API](https://apis.openocean.finance/). Fetch swap quotes, build transaction calldata, and execute swaps across 40+ chains (EVM, Solana, Sui).

## Entry Point and Sub-Skills

This skill package is the **entry point**. Detailed workflows live in the following files under `skills/`:

| User intent | Skill file | When to use |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Get quote / check price | `skills/quote/SKILL.md` | "get a swap quote", "check swap price", "how much would I get for" |
| Build transaction | `skills/swap-build/SKILL.md` | "build a swap", "prepare swap transaction", "get swap calldata" |
| Execute (with confirmation) | `skills/swap-execute/SKILL.md` | "execute swap", "broadcast swap", "send transaction" |
| Execute fast (no confirmation) | `skills/swap-execute-fast/SKILL.md` | "swap fast", "execute immediately" — use with extreme caution |
| Errors and troubleshooting | `skills/error-handling/SKILL.md` | API errors, token resolution failures, execution failures |

**Reference files** (read before calling APIs):

- `references/token-registry.md` — Token addresses and decimals per chain
- `references/api-reference.md` — OpenOcean API specification

All paths above are relative to the **workspace root** (the directory that contains this `SKILL.md`).

## Prerequisites

- **Quote / Build**: Only need GET request capability (e.g. `mcp_web_fetch`).
- **Execute**: Require [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) (`cast`), RPC URL, and wallet (env, Ledger, Trezor, or keystore).

## Quick Examples

```
/quote 1 ETH to USDC on ethereum
/swap-build 100 USDC to ETH on arbitrum from 0xYourAddress
/swap-execute
```

For full workflows, confirmation prompts, and error handling, follow the corresponding `skills/*/SKILL.md` file.
